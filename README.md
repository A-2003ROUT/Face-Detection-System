# Face-Detection-System
This project focuses on building a Face Detection system that can accurately identify and locate human faces within digital images or video streams. Using advanced computer vision techniques, the system employs machine learning models such as Haar Cascades, HOG + SVM, or deep learning-based CNN models (like MTCNN or SSD) to detect faces with high precision.
The project demonstrates real-time face detection capabilities and is designed to handle variations in lighting, orientation, and facial expressions. Applications include security systems, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.

Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)

Dlib (optional for advanced face detection)

Key Features:

Real-time face detection through webcam/video

Multi-face detection in a single frame

Robustness to scale and lighting variations

Potential extension to face recognition or emotion detection
